ASES Manila: Brand Guidelines for Agents

Effective: January 2026

1. Brand Heart & Philosophy

Before designing, understand the core message. We are not just about ideas; we are about execution.

Who we are: A catalyst that transforms passive Dreamers into active Builders.

The Mission: To provide the steps, community, and mindset shift required to make today "Day One."

The Tagline: "Turning dreamers, to builders"

The Vibe: Grit. Action. Shift from thinking to doing.

2. Visual Identity: Color Palette

Our colors are bold and primary. Use specific Hex codes to ensure consistency across all platforms.

Color Name	Hex Code	Usage
ASES Red	#EB4428	Primary accent, bold highlights
Sky Blue	#97B6F8	Secondary accent, softer elements
Core Blue	#3F439C	Primary brand color
Deep Navy	#251E72	Backgrounds, depth, dark mode text
3. Typography

Our type scale creates a clear, balanced hierarchy.

Philosophy: We use rounded, practical values based loosely on the Golden Ratio (1.618) for readability.

Hierarchy Guide

HEADER: Cocogoose Bold (or Classic)

Note: Used for main titles. Bold and impactful.

SUBHEADING: Public Sans

Style: ALL CAPS

Note: Used to break up text or introduce sections.

BODY TEXT: Montserrat

Note: Clean, easily readable. Do not make this too small.

SUBTEXT: Montserrat (Smaller size)

Note: For captions or small details.

> Tip: Cocogoose, Public Sans, and Montserrat are available in Canva.

4. Design Rules & Layout
Color Matching (Do's & Don'ts)

Avoid eye strain. High contrast is key.

✅ DO: Use White text on Brand Color backgrounds (Red or Blue).

✅ DO: Use Dark Blue/Navy text on White backgrounds.

✅ DO: Use Red text on White backgrounds (for titles).

❌ DON'T: Use Red text on a Blue background. It vibrates and strains the eyes.

❌ DON'T: Use Blue text on a Red background.

Margins (Safe Zones)

"No Text Here": Keep a generous buffer around the edges of your canvas.

Do not push text or logos to the very edge of the image. Leave breathing room to ensure nothing gets cut off on different screen sizes.

Imagery & Assets

The Mascot (Origami Bird):

Use sparingly.

Only add it when you need to convey motivation or share the specific "dreamer to builder" message.

It should not be plastered on every single post.

Decorative Lines:

Use sparingly. They are accents, not the main focus.

5. Voice & Tone

When writing copy for ASES Manila, keep these traits in mind:

Action-Oriented: Avoid passive language. Use verbs like "Build," "Create," "Start."

Direct: We don't sugarcoat the hard work. We focus on the "grit of the start."

Empowering: We believe "one day" is a trap. Encourage the audience to start now.
